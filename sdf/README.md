### Signed Distance Fields
This is a bells-and-whistles demo of signed distance fields. Most of this stuff comes from Inigo Quilez's brilliant homepage http://iquilezles.org/index.html, in particular:
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/raymarchingdf/raymarchingdf.htm
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm

There are a number of things being demonstrated including:
- SDF Constructive Solid Geometry
- SDF Blending
- Raymarching SDF's
- Animating SDF's
- Shading SDF's
- Ambient Occlusion
- Shadows

Be aware that the resolution of your window has a huge impact on performance, so if you see it's starting to grind, make your window smaller!
