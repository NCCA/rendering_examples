### Anisotropic reflectance based on surface curvature
This is an example of using curvature to automatically get shading effects, but is also demonstrates a couple of applications of the geometry shader: here to generate visualisation vectors and also to orient anisotropic shading fields.

The method is described in more detail here: https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/rsouthern/researchblog/curv/
