### Silhouette Fin Rendering on the Geometry Shader
This is a relatively simple method to generate silhouette (i.e. outline) geometry which helps with non-photorealistic rendering to give the impression that someone sketched the outline of the image with a thick pen. The geometry is created on the Geometry Shader, so this is a good place to look to learn about the technique.

Note that this is pretty well described in the following post: https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/rsouthern/researchblog/fins/
