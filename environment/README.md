### Environment mapping
This demo demonstrates the use of the environment mapping Level of Detail method as a method for creating different degrees of glossiness in the form of sharpening / smudging the reflection of the environment map. The actually glossiness is taken from a texture map to purposely look all smudgy and messy. Most of the fun is in env_frag.glsl.
