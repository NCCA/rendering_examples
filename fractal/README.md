### 2D fractal rendering on the GPU
This is a simple 2D fractal rendering technique largely taken from the following link: http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/sdr_fract/ . It also uses Subroutines to flip between the different fractal techniques. It is a good example of generating visuals on a plane using the fragment shader.

The color palette technique is taken from http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm .
