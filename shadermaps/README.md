### Combining multiple reflectance properties, light sources and textures
This is an attempt at a "bells and whistles" demo which combines multiple texture maps (colour, gloss, normals, specular, environment light sources) along with a PBR shader to create a scene which gets closer to production quality.

It hasn't quite got there - a lot more tweaking and testing will be necessary, and a scene needs to be used that is considerably more plausible (without distorted texture maps). However the basic structure of the application is there.
